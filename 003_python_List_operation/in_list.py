# Python offers two very powerful operators, 

# able to look through the list in order to check whether a specific 

# value is stored inside the list or not.



## The first of them (in) checks if a given element (its left argument) 

## is currently stored somewhere inside the list (the right argument) 

### - the operator returns 'True' in this case.



## The second (not in) checks if a given element (its left argument)

## is absent in a list - the operator returns 'True' in this case.
